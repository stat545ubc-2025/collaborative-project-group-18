## Introduction

This repository contains the first collaborative project for Group 18 :smiley:. The project serves as a practical demonstration of our team's proficiency in:

1. **Git and GitHub Workflow**: Collaborating effectively on a shared codebase using version control best practices, including branching, merging, and pull requests.
2. **R Programming**: Applying and reinforcing R programming concepts through hands-on practice.

## File Structure

- README.md: You're reading this file!
- TEAMWORK.md: contains information about team members and a guideline as to how the members will be working together (e.g. division of labour, timing for pull requests and reviews, and mode of communication)
- troubleshooting-1.rmd: document in which we fixed 3 coding errors
- hello_world.R: a simple R script demonstrating basic R functionality and serving as a practice file for running R scripts from the terminal

## Execution

The markdown files are ready to read - no need to execute! The R-markdown file can be opened and tested using RStudio.

The hello_world.R file can be run by executing:

```shell
rscript hello_world.R
```

in the terminal!
